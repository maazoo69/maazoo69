Hello, I'm [Maaz ]! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am passionate about C++ programming and software development. Here you will find a collection of my projects and contributions in the world of C++.

About Me
I am a software developer with expertise in C++ and a strong background in computer science. I enjoy solving complex problems and creating efficient and robust solutions. My experience includes working with various libraries and frameworks, as well as collaborating on both individual and team projects.

Projects
Here are some of the projects I have been working on:

Project 1: [The C++ Billing System using OOP concepts is a software application that helps manage billing and invoicing processes for a business. It utilizes object-oriented programming principles to create a modular and efficient system. The system includes features such as customer management, product management, invoice generation, payment tracking, and reporting. It is implemented in C++ and provides a user-friendly interface for handling billing operations.]


Contributions
I actively contribute to the open-source community and believe in the power of collaboration. Some of my notable contributions include:

[iostream]: [he iostream library is used to handle input and output operations in the code. It allows the code to interact with the user by reading input using cin and displaying output using cout. In the code, cin is used to gather user input for item names, prices, and quantities, while cout is used to display the final invoice and other information.]
[string: [string: The string library provides the string class and functions for working with strings. In the code, the string library is used to store and manipulate customer names, item names, and other string-related data. It is used to define and handle variables such as customerName and itemName.]
You can find more details about my contributions in the respective repositories.
